The standalone server accepts static bearer keys or `msk-v1` access keys when configured in `~/.milim/config/server.json`. The desktop app uses its own per-launch bearer token and resolves the actual loopback port through Tauri.

## Compatible APIs

| API | Endpoint | Use |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI chat | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible SDKs and tools. |
| OpenAI responses | `POST /v1/responses` | Responses-compatible clients, including `input`, `instructions`, `tools`, streaming, reasoning effort, and `text.format`. |
| OpenAI completions | `POST /v1/completions` | Legacy prompt-completion clients. |
| OpenAI models | `GET /v1/models` | Model discovery. |
| OpenAI embeddings | `POST /v1/embeddings` | Embedding-compatible clients. |
| Anthropic messages | `POST /anthropic/v1/messages` | Claude Messages-compatible clients. |
| Ollama chat | `POST /api/chat` | Ollama clients that speak `/api/chat`, including `think` and streamed or final `message.thinking`. |
| Ollama generate | `POST /api/generate` | Ollama prompt-style generation, including `prompt`, `suffix`, `raw`, `options`, `think`, and `format`; empty-prompt `keep_alive` lifecycle calls are forwarded to native Ollama backends when available. |
| Ollama tags | `GET /api/tags` | Ollama-style model discovery. |

Structured-output controls are passed through to the selected backend: OpenAI `response_format`, Responses `text.format`, and Ollama `format` are normalized onto the internal completion request where supported.

Multimodal compatibility inputs remain provider-native: OpenAI Chat uses `image_url` content parts, Responses accepts `input_image`, Ollama accepts message `images`, and Anthropic Messages accepts base64 or HTTP(S) URL image sources. Malformed or unsupported Anthropic sources return an invalid-request error instead of being discarded. Gemini receives uploaded bytes as `inline_data`; only genuine `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/.../files/...` URIs become `file_data`, and arbitrary web image URLs fail validation without a server-side downloader.

Root aliases are also mounted for OpenAI chat, completions, models, and embeddings: `/chat/completions`, `/completions`, `/models`, and `/embeddings`.

`POST /memory/graph/search` is the compatibility route for scoped hybrid retrieval; it does not perform graph traversal. The request and response shapes are unchanged. Each `MemoryGraphHit.score` is normalized fused relevance in `0..1`, combining exact-term FTS and embedding ranks with equal-weight reciprocal rank fusion. Scope, archive, and `top_k` filters still apply. Desktop turns request 20 candidates and inject no more than five provenance-labeled entries within a 1,024-token memory budget.

`GET /mcp/tools` is the complete agent-configuration catalog and each entry includes an `effect` (`read_only`, `mutating`, `command`, or `unknown`). `GET /mcp/tools?callable=true` returns the read-only subset that `POST /mcp/call` can invoke; mutations must run through an agent with Review approval or Open mode. External MCP tools use stable id-derived namespaces, cannot shadow first-party tools, and default to `unknown` unless their MCP annotations explicitly mark them read-only. Previous display-name-derived MCP names remain accepted as non-advertised aliases for saved custom-agent selections.

The authenticated MCP Apps POST routes are for the desktop host, not iframe code. `resources/read` accepts only an advertised `ui://` resource from a server that negotiated Apps, requires `text/html;profile=mcp-app`, and caps decoded HTML at 5 MiB. For rendering, it returns a random, one-use `/mcp/apps/views/{id}` capability path backed only by bounded memory; the GET needs no bearer because its unguessable path is the capability, expires after ten minutes if unused, and returns `no-store`. `tools/call` resolves the app-visible tool in the supplied originating server, applies Review/Guarded/Open server-side, and enforces the 1 MiB result boundary. The iframe never receives the desktop's bearer token. The original read-only `/mcp/call` contract is unchanged.

`http_fetch` accepts public HTTP(S) destinations only, validates every redirect, applies DNS/address checks, and limits transfer time and body size. It rejects loopback, private, link-local, multicast, and metadata-service addresses.

`POST /media/generate` and `GET /media/status` remain backward-compatible and additionally return `library_id` and `save_state` when the local library is enabled. `GET /media/library` accepts optional `query`, `kind`, `provider`, `status`, `cursor`, and `limit` parameters and returns `items` plus `next_cursor`. Refresh resumes a stored pending provider run or retries a failed local save. Content lookup serves only an allowlisted file recorded under that library item's UUID directory, and delete permanently removes the directory before removing the index record. The library index is `~/.milim/media/index.json`; media files are under `~/.milim/media/files/<library-id>/`.

`POST /schedules` and `PUT /schedules/{id}` require a provider/local API `model` for deterministic unattended execution; `codex:*` and `claude:*` account models are rejected. The optional `attachments` array uses the desktop chat shape (`id`, `name`, `mime`, `size`, `content`, `dataUrl`, `truncated`, `sourcePath`). Text content is appended to the scheduled prompt and stored image data becomes a real image part each time the automation fires. A legacy image without `dataUrl` records a visible error asking for reattachment. Existing schedules may have an empty model for compatibility; the runner falls back to their linked Agent's deprecated model, and records a visible error if neither exists. `GET /schedules/events` drains completed results for the desktop to land as local threads.

`POST /codex/run` and `POST /claude/run` accept an optional `images` array of `{ "media_type": "image/png", "data": "<base64 bytes>" }`. PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF are limited to 2 MB each, and either a non-empty `prompt` or at least one valid image is required. Codex materializes validated bytes into temporary per-turn files and sends app-server `localImage` inputs; Claude pipes a native multimodal user message with base64 image blocks through `--input-format stream-json`. Account-runtime images require Privacy Off.

`GET /workspace/context` returns the canonical root, sanitized origin display, stable and legacy Project memory locators, ordered AGENTS/Claude instruction files with contents, byte counts and statuses, plus discovery warnings. AGENTS loading uses override precedence and a 32 KiB aggregate limit; path-conditional Claude rules are returned as conditional with a warning rather than applied globally.

Streamed run requests accept optional `interactive_tool_approval`. In Review, a consequential call emits `tool_approval_required { approval_id, call_id, name, arguments, effect }`; resolve it with authenticated `POST /tool-approvals/{approval_id}` and `{ "decision": "approve" | "deny" }`. A successful first resolution returns `204`, an expired/unknown id returns `404`, and a repeated resolution returns `409`. The stream then emits `tool_approval_resolved`. Approvals are ephemeral, exact, and one-shot. `tool_approval_grant: true` remains the explicit whole-run option for headless callers.

The built-in `memory_register` tool accepts `content`, optional `title`, and optional `scope` (`personal` or `project`). The lower-level `/memory/*` HTTP routes remain compatible with scoped node records.

## msk-v1 keys

`msk-v1` keys are signed local access tokens. The token layout is `msk-v1.<base64url(payload)>.<hex(sig65)>`. The payload is canonical JSON with alphabetical keys, and the signature is a secp256k1 recoverable signature over the `"Milim Signed Access"` domain-separated digest.

| Payload field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `aud` | Audience address the key authorizes against. |
| `cnt` | Monotonic counter used with revocation. |
| `exp` | Optional Unix-seconds expiry. |
| `iat` | Issued-at Unix timestamp. |
| `iss` | Issuer address, which must match the recovered signer. |
| `lbl` | Optional human label. |
| `nonce` | Random nonce used with revocation. |

```powershell Mint an msk-v1 key
cargo run -p milim-cli -- keys identity
cargo run -p milim-cli -- keys mint --label local-client --expires-secs 86400
```

Set `authRequired: true` in `server.json` to make `milim serve` accept keys minted by this machine. `milim serve --expose` saves that setting and prints a one-time token when no auth is already configured. Use `--audience` when minting a key for a different Milim identity. Omitting it mints for this machine's own address.

## Common failures

| Status | Usually means |
|---|---|
| 401 | Missing or invalid bearer token or access key. |
| 404 | Route group is not mounted in this build or the id does not exist. |
| 409 | Local state rejected the requested mutation. |
