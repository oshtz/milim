# milim

milim is a model-agnostic software development desktop app for people who switch between models, providers, and subscriptions constantly. It embeds a Rust backend with a local HTTP API, supports OpenAI-compatible, Ollama-compatible, and Anthropic-compatible routes, and brings provider-agnostic dev chat, encrypted provider management, Codex and bring-your-own Claude CLI account runtimes, agents/tools, memory/RAG, media generation, artifact workflows, and outbound privacy controls into one app.

Desktop release artifacts currently target Windows and macOS. Linux packaging is intentionally disabled, but the Rust server and Tauri app remain source-buildable on supported platforms.

## Quickstart

```bash
# build the Rust workspace
cargo build --release

# run the server with an OpenAI-compatible local endpoint, on port 7377
MILIM_REMOTE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1 cargo run -p milim-cli -- serve

# in another shell
cargo run -p milim-cli -- status
```

## Usage

Run `milim serve` to expose the local HTTP API, then point OpenAI-compatible clients at `http://127.0.0.1:7377/v1`. Configure the CLI backend with `MILIM_REMOTE_BASE_URL` and optional `MILIM_REMOTE_API_KEY`; for local inference, point it at an external runtime such as Ollama or LM Studio.

For the desktop app:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm -C apps/desktop install
pnpm -C apps/desktop tauri dev
```

### CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `serve [--port N] [--expose]` | Start the HTTP server; `--expose` binds on the LAN and auto-enables `msk-v1` auth if no auth is configured. |
| `status [--url URL] [--port N] [--token T] [--json]` | Probe a running server's health. |
| `models [--url URL] [--port N] [--token T] [--json]` | List models from a running server. |
| `run [--url URL] [--port N] [--token T] [--system S] [--temperature N] [--max-tokens N] <model> [prompt...]` | Chat through the running server: one-shot if a prompt is given, else an interactive REPL. |
| `keys identity` / `keys mint [...]` | Print this machine's address / mint an `msk-v1` access token. |
| `mcp [--url URL] [--port N] [--token T]` | Run the stdio MCP bridge for Claude Desktop and other MCP clients. |
| `version` | Print the version. |

OpenAI-compatible example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7377/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"llama3.2","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}],"stream":true}'
```

Ollama clients can use `http://127.0.0.1:7377/api/chat` or prompt-style `http://127.0.0.1:7377/api/generate`; `/api/chat` accepts `think` and returns `message.thinking` for reasoning models, and empty-prompt `keep_alive` lifecycle calls are forwarded to native Ollama backends when available.

## Backends

The CLI server chooses a backend from the environment. If none is configured, `/v1/models` returns an empty list and chat requests return a setup error instead of a synthetic response.

| Backend | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Remote / local provider** | `MILIM_REMOTE_BASE_URL` (+ `MILIM_REMOTE_API_KEY`) | Forwards to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as Ollama `/v1`, LM Studio `/v1`, vLLM, OpenAI, or OpenRouter. |

Milim does not ship a GGUF runtime. Local GGUF inference belongs in dedicated runtimes such as Ollama or LM Studio; Milim integrates with them through their API surfaces. Ollama thinking models can use Milim reasoning effort controls through `/v1/chat/completions`; LM Studio models with native reasoning metadata use LM Studio's `/api/v1/chat` reasoning settings when no custom tools are attached and `/v1/responses` for Milim function-tool requests, while `gpt-oss` low/medium/high effort keeps using LM Studio's `/v1/responses` path. Structured-output controls are forwarded through OpenAI `response_format`, Ollama `format`, and Responses `text.format` where the selected backend supports them. The desktop app manages encrypted provider records for OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Anthropic, Gemini, Replicate, fal, local Ollama, local LM Studio, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints; duplicate provider model ids stay provider-scoped in the picker and route back to the selected provider. Codex and the installed Claude CLI are account runtimes backed by user-installed CLIs; they are separate from saved provider records, appear in the model picker after authentication, and use Milim approval modes with visible tool events.

OpenRouter requests identify the app as `milim` using `https://milim.ai/` for OpenRouter analytics and attribution.

At desktop startup, the picker loads the cached catalog while one live refresh checks enabled chat providers, then reconciles automatically when that refresh finishes. Provider, Codex, and Claude discovery fail independently so one unavailable runtime does not hide the others.

Milim does not include Claude Code, does not provide Anthropic credentials, and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic. This integration only invokes the user's separately installed official Claude CLI on the local machine. Use of Claude and Claude Code is governed by Anthropic's terms. Users must install the Claude CLI separately, authenticate through Claude's own tooling, and Milim does not manage or receive Claude credentials.

Claude CLI integration boundaries:

- Milim invokes the local `claude` executable.
- Milim does not bundle Claude Code, proxy Claude access, or sell Claude access.
- Authentication is handled by the official Claude CLI.
- Milim does not read Claude credentials.
- Claude CLI usage remains subject to Anthropic's terms.
- Open mode for Claude CLI maps to Claude's `bypassPermissions` mode, which may run tools and commands without additional Claude prompts; use it only in trusted workspaces.
- Stale-session recovery asks before stopping a matching local Claude CLI process and does not delete Claude session registry files by default.

Built-in tool safety is enforced server-side. Each run captures its workspace and preview target. Plan is read-only, Guarded exposes only tools declared read-only, Review pauses each mutating, command, or unknown invocation on an inline exact-arguments Approve/Deny card, and Open executes eligible calls automatically. Review approvals are unguessable, one-shot, and canceled when the stream stops; the legacy whole-run grant remains available only for explicit non-interactive API callers. Direct `POST /mcp/call` is read-only even though `GET /mcp/tools` returns the full catalog for agent configuration. The desktop resets tool approval to Guarded whenever a chat's workspace folder changes, so Open permission does not carry across project boundaries. Filesystem tools reject traversal through symlinks/junctions, use atomic replacement for writes, and support bounded ranged reads. `http_fetch` permits public HTTP(S) destinations only. Host and Docker commands have time/output limits; Docker runs also use no-network, memory, CPU, PID, capability, and read-only-root restrictions by default.

Workspace turns reload repository instructions every turn. Milim-native loads Codex-style `AGENTS.md`/`AGENTS.override.md` plus Claude `CLAUDE.md` and unconditional `.claude/rules/**/*.md`; Codex receives only the Claude-family additions and Claude receives only the AGENTS-family additions so native discovery is not duplicated. The authenticated Context API exposes ordered sources and warnings. Git remotes are sanitized into stable project identities, so clones and worktrees share Project memory while legacy exact-folder memories remain readable.

Milim is also an inline [MCP Apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/blob/main/specification/2026-01-26/apps.mdx) host for negotiated stdio servers. A model-visible MCP tool can attach an advertised `ui://` view, which Milim renders at that tool call and connects back only to app-visible tools on the same server. Apps are server-authored live views; artifacts remain model-authored files/content and keep their existing panel and revision workflow. App descriptors and initial results persist, remote HTML does not, and reopening re-fetches the resource or leaves the textual tool result as fallback. Validated HTML is exposed only through a random, short-lived, memory-only view URL with a generated CSP; the iframe receives no bearer token.

Standalone auth is configured in `~/.milim/config/server.json`: set `authRequired: true` to accept locally minted `msk-v1` keys, add static bearer secrets under `apiKeys`, or trust extra signed-key issuers under `accessKeyIssuers`. `milim serve --expose` persists `authRequired: true` and prints an immediate `MILIM_API_TOKEN` when no auth is already configured. CLI client commands accept `--url`, `--port`, and `--token` (`MILIM_API_TOKEN`) when calling an authenticated server. The desktop app disables loopback trust and uses a per-launch bearer token for its embedded server. Empty CORS allow-list means no browser origins are allowed; set explicit origins at `~/.milim/config/server.json` when needed.

## Desktop App

The Tauri app embeds the server in-process; the app is the server, so there is no separate `serve` process. Closing the desktop window hides it to the system tray so the embedded backend keeps running; use the tray menu to reopen or quit.

If a desktop UI render crash reaches the app root, Milim shows a reloadable error screen instead of a blank window.

```bash
pnpm -C apps/desktop install
pnpm -C apps/desktop tauri dev
```

Shipped UI:

- Unified first-run setup follows Model, Defaults, optional Context, and Ready. Advanced features are always available; the collapsed sidebar Tools launcher opens MCP servers, Skills, Schedules, and the media manager.
- The first product loop is dev chat: connect a provider or account runtime, pick a workspace folder, ask for an edit or test run, switch models inline, and continue the same thread without resetting workspace context, memory, previews, artifacts, approvals, or queued messages.
- Desktop motion is frequency-aware: shortcut-driven search, model, context-menu, and thread changes stay instant; occasional panels use short interruptible transitions; reordered rows track the pointer directly; and reduced-motion preferences remove spatial movement and spinning while retaining perceivable status.
- Hot Swap keeps the Milim thread canonical while models change: compatible switches stay immediate, lossy handoffs show a compact preflight, stale Codex/Claude sessions offer Fresh or Resume, and the latest response can be continued, reviewed read-only, or retried with another model. Coding retries use the pre-turn Git checkpoint in an isolated worktree whose reviewed diff can be applied back to the original workspace.
- Empty chats show local, repository-aware starter prompts derived from the active branch, worktree state, and recent commits; selecting one only prefills the composer.
- Desktop profile data uses verified SQLite WAL mode. Session persistence stores only changed session/message rows, while durable Worker Runs remain canonical in `threads.db` instead of the UI snapshot.
- Chat sessions with row-backed desktop persistence, Markdown-rendered user and assistant message bodies with raw source preserved for actions, memoized live Markdown streaming for normal assistant tails with preserved-text fallback for long streams before full Markdown finalize, browser-opening message links, reasoning blocks, virtualized long transcripts, compact live tool activity with expandable details, syntax-highlighted short code snippets, collapsed generated code artifacts, attachments, a compact interruptible and reorderable queued-send tray, persisted thread-local composer drafts and history recall with transient position feedback, immediate Plan/Goal mode pills from slash autocomplete, first-message and optional AI thread titles, copy with transient confirmation, regenerate/edit-and-resend, in-place assistant edits, message deletion, branch-from-message, JSON/Markdown thread export/import, filtered search, compact sidebar thread rows with pin/archive hover actions and branch/export in the right-click menu, project rows with pin/new-chat hover actions and archive in the right-click menu, custom right-click menus for app objects while preserving native text/link editing menus, tokenizer-backed context compaction checkpoints that reject truncated summaries, keep a bounded recent tail verbatim, cap old attachment/tool bodies in summary prompts, and track lifetime/since-checkpoint usage totals, persisted sidebar/context/inspector state with animated project/chat section collapse and five-at-a-time per-section thread reveals, response metrics that update after each built-in tool-agent model request, generated artifact previews with thread-local revision cycling, built-in scoped preview tools for the active DOM-capable preview surface, no-folder virtual project files with review/apply and versioned artifact sources, visual-only preview activity cues for tool events with click-through browser-preview overlays, native App/URL previews that yield to overlapping app dialogs and popovers, inline/display-only handling for anonymous code and markdown tables, lightweight anonymous script/TSX preview fallbacks, managed no-folder Node preview apps from named file metadata with package-manager detection, a required `dev` script, Vite entry/style and Tailwind config fallbacks, full named-file staging within the preview size budget, and selected-folder Node preview apps that run that folder directly without staged-file rewrites. Runnable apps never execute on generation: the inspector first shows a read-only command/scope/fingerprint review, then requires an explicit Run; managed files are staged only after that confirmation. Runtime state distinguishes active from ready, survives transient polling failures, reports compile failures without discarding the last URL, and supports a cancellable install/start lifecycle. The unified Preview / Code / Git / Workers inspector keeps artifact revisions, app state, manual URL history, and Worker history independent per thread.
- Negotiated MCP Apps render interactive charts, diagrams, forms, dashboards, and viewers inline at their originating tool call. They use an opaque-origin sandbox, server-declared CSP allow-list, same-server tool/resource bridge, Review/Guarded/Open enforcement, theme and bounded resize updates, and text fallback when their server is unavailable; they never enter the artifact panel.
- Milim-native provider and local-model chats can list, test, save, enable/disable, and remove Milim-managed MCP servers. Guarded permits listing only, Review pauses command or mutation calls on the existing exact-arguments approval card, and Open executes them directly. Credential-looking environment variables are accepted only as value-free placeholders; enter their values afterward in the encrypted MCP Manager. Newly connected tools become callable on the next chat turn.
- PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF attachments up to 2 MB each are forwarded as real image content to provider chat, server-side agent runs, provider-backed schedules, Codex app-server turns, and Claude CLI turns; no OCR or text fallback substitutes for the pixels. Outbound turns keep the latest images plus complete recent image-bearing turns within a 20 MiB encoded-image budget; older pixels remain visible in the transcript but become an omission note in model context. Requests above 30 MiB fail locally with removal/compaction guidance instead of reaching the server's 32 MiB cap. Codex uses temporary per-turn `localImage` files that are deleted when the turn ends, while Claude receives native base64 image blocks over `stream-json`. Oversized, unsupported, unreadable, or legacy scheduled images without stored data fail visibly. Desktop attachment reads remain limited to files picked in the native dialog or workspace-relative files under the selected folder.
- Provider onboarding for OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Ollama, LM Studio, custom OpenAI-compatible remotes, Anthropic, Gemini, and Replicate/fal media with encrypted key storage and model capability metadata, including native local vision/tool-use labels where available; account-runtime onboarding for Codex and the installed Claude CLI, with per-chat native session persistence, consent-gated Claude session recovery, Milim approval modes, and visible tool events. The model chip is the sole visible model selector; its picker shows provider, runtime lane, setup status, capabilities, Favorites, per-model reasoning effort, and whether the next turn is plain chat, Milim tools, Codex runtime, Claude runtime, or media. Provider and runtime groups can be collapsed, with one shared layout persisted across every picker surface.
- Per-model reasoning effort controls where the provider, local runtime, or account runtime advertises supported effort levels.
- Model-agnostic Agents store reusable roles with deterministic avatar seeds; the same generated identity follows persona, schedule, and assigned Worker surfaces without image files, while unassigned Workers receive deterministic run-local identities. Workers are live instances grouped into durable Runs on the canonical parent chat. Context shows compact Worker avatars plus planned/active/done counts; the Workers inspector groups the parent chat's full history into Active and Done, opens transcript-linked Runs directly, keeps Active Workers and the selected Worker stable as progress arrives, and owns delegation settings, Ask approval, Markdown-rendered transcripts and results, stopping, retry with the same or another model, Run deletion, and diff review. Running Workers keep their parent thread visibly active in the sidebar, while Workers never become sidebar chats. On narrow layouts the Worker history stacks above the selected detail, grows only to its content up to half the inspector height, and scrolls beyond that cap. Each thread defaults to Ask delegation and can switch Off/Ask/Auto or choose a Worker model from the searchable catalog; bare delegated model names resolve to an unambiguous catalog `provider/model` id. Ask freezes an exact approval plan and pauses the parent until the user runs the workers or continues solo; Auto joins parallel results before the parent answer. The Worker Run stream is the sole owner of managed Worker progress. Before resuming the parent, desktop reloads the canonical terminal Run, verifies every returned Worker is terminal, and requires successful or partial Runs to include every planned Worker. Results join through one hidden context message; pending approved joins survive a desktop reload. If none succeeded, the parent acknowledges the failures and continues the original request without delegating again. Retries create new Runs so failed history remains intact until explicitly deleted. Approved writers use isolated Git worktrees with explicit diff apply; non-Git workspaces fall back to read-only. Schedules remain single-agent.
- Memory/RAG with Personal and Git-stable Project libraries, at most five relevant entries injected per enabled turn, dual reads from stable and legacy exact-folder scopes, archive/recovery controls, legacy thread-memory recovery, explicit tool-capable writes, and provider-routed embeddings behind the same remote privacy gate.
- Workspace and Git panels with guarded fetch/commit/sync actions, a review-first local diff workspace for all, unstaged, staged, last-turn, commit, and branch comparisons, and a hideable, resizable changed-file tree on the left that navigates the unified diff. Git also supports local branch switching and creation, model-generated commit subjects when the message is left blank, turn-level Git worktree checkpoints with restore actions, a unified Preview / Code / Git / Workers inspector, and a persisted thread-local Context card with a compact Worker summary plus independently collapsible environment, task, live activity, context, and sources sections. Context groups the current prompt estimate, free tokens, fixed-context categories, repository-rule files, and warnings under a collapsed Prompt context disclosure; provider-reported usage remains separately labeled as cumulative usage. Sources show five filename-only, single-line entries at a time and open their attachment, artifact, or memory target. Context's reserved 300px slot pushes the transcript while its scrollbar stays at the thread view's right edge, can coexist with the inspector on wide layouts, and becomes mutually exclusive with it on narrow layouts. A workspace launcher appears only for folder-backed threads and opens the active folder in installed local tools; filesystem/shell tools remain rooted to the selected folder, generated-file diff review/apply/save-to-workspace flows use selected artifact revisions, Docker sandbox runs remain isolated, preview DOM tools require an active ready surface, optional computer-use controls OS input, and Review/Guarded/Open gate tool execution.
- The latest code-changing turn exposes Undo changes, which restores its pre-turn checkpoint, removes the assistant response, retains the original request, and clears native runtime state that no longer matches the workspace.
- Privacy gate with Off, Redact, and Block modes enforced server-side before remote-provider and account-runtime calls. Remote providers and account runtimes receive image pixels only in Privacy Off; local Ollama and LM Studio vision remain local and allowed.
- Image, video, and prompt-to-music generation through configured OpenRouter, fal, and Replicate providers, with kind-aware model discovery, schema controls, status polling, native music playback, and window-filling in-app previews for generated images and videos. OpenRouter image generation is live-verified; video/music and fal/Replicate music have mocked adapter coverage but still require separate credentialed smoke verification.
- Mobile companion for paired phones, with restart-proof pairing, persisted phone URL base, startup Tailscale Serve repair when the bridge is enabled, in-app QR scanning, active desktop theme mirroring, Markdown-rendered live thread viewing/switching through a project-aware mobile sidebar, compact Worker plan approval/progress/results/stop controls, new-thread/stop/regenerate/rename/archive/delete controls, mobile file/photo attachments, model switching, phone sends through the desktop composer/model path, pairing, enable/disable, queued events, device revocation, and a Tailscale Serve setup helper that opens Tailscale download when missing and creates phone-reachable tailnet HTTPS URLs where available.
- The title-bar logo opens a compact keyboard-accessible app menu for common actions without adding another UI row; macOS builds also expose native Milim, File, Edit, View, Window, and Help menus.
- Searchable settings with section status indicators, themes with contrast validation for custom palettes, custom style settings, and default-off locally synthesized sounds. Sound settings independently control attention alerts, active-chat completion cues, their palettes, and optional interaction feedback. Configurable app-window keyboard shortcuts include `Ctrl/Cmd+K` for a command-and-chat palette and `Ctrl+Tab` for the compact recent-thread switcher. Ctrl/Cmd `+` and `-` adjust UI scaling with transient title-bar controls. The title bar can show cumulative thread usage and active Codex/Claude account usage. The app also includes resizable sidebar/inspector dividers, frameless window controls, close-to-tray background mode, persisted window state, shared app notices for background events, bounded local-only desktop logs with recovery actions, and startup plus background GitHub Release update checks for Windows/macOS artifacts with checksum verification, visible download progress, and a top-bar one-click install action.

## Test

```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
pnpm -C apps/desktop verify
pnpm -C apps/desktop verify:tester-ready

## Release Artifacts

The release workflow publishes stable Windows portable EXE and macOS universal DMG/app zip artifacts:

- `milim-windows-x64-portable.exe`
- `milim-macos-universal.dmg`
- `milim.app.zip`

Linux release packaging is intentionally disabled in `apps/desktop/scripts/package-release.mjs`.

Release builds run desktop verification on both macOS and Windows, require Apple signing secrets for macOS artifacts, intentionally enable Tauri's macOS private API for transparent preview activity overlay windows, and publish `manifest.json` plus an aggregate `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the current release run. Updater assets are verified with SHA-256 sidecars and the aggregate checksum file.
